# AI-Powered MCQ Extraction and Creation


This repository contains an implementation for an **AI-Powered MCQ Scraper & Generator**. The project leverages **Large Language Models (LLMs) via Ollama** and **web scraping techniques** to automatically extract, format, and even generate Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) directly from web page content. This tool is designed to assist educators, students, and content creators in quickly gathering and refining educational question sets, particularly tailored for standards like CBSE.

## üìå Project Overview

Creating and curating high-quality MCQs can be time-consuming. This project streamlines the process by intelligently scraping web pages for existing questions and using AI to understand, structure, and enhance them. Furthermore, it can generate entirely new questions based on the identified topic, providing a comprehensive solution for MCQ resource development. The core aim is to automate the extraction and creation of relevant, well-formatted MCQs.

## üõ† Features

-   **Intelligent Web Scraping**: Leverages **Selenium** to effectively scrape content from dynamic web pages that might require JavaScript rendering.
-   **Dual Extraction Methods**: Employs **direct HTML parsing** (e.g., for known site structures like `studiestoday.com`) for efficiency, and falls back to **AI-powered extraction** using an LLM for broader compatibility.
-   **AI-Enhanced Formatting**: Utilizes an **LLM** to refine extracted MCQs, ensuring they meet specific criteria (e.g., 4 options, CBSE standard), improve clarity, and add missing answers or explanations.
-   **AI Question Generation**: Creates **new, relevant MCQs** based on the topic identified from the scraped content, complete with difficulty levels and explanations.
-   **Configurable Operation**: Allows users to specify the target **class level (10, 11, 12)**, the **Ollama model** to use, and the **Ollama host URL** via command-line arguments.
-   **Batch Processing**: Supports processing **multiple URLs** provided in a text file for efficient bulk operations.
-   **Structured Output**: Saves all processed (formatted) and newly generated MCQs into organized **JSON files** for easy downstream use.

## üìÑ Input Sources

This tool operates on **web page URLs** provided by the user. The target URLs should ideally contain MCQs or textual content from which MCQs can be derived (e.g., educational articles, question banks). The tool adapts its strategy based on whether it can directly parse MCQs or needs to use the LLM for extraction from general text.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed and configured:

-   **Python** (Version 3.8 or higher recommended).
-   **Google Chrome** browser.
-   **ChromeDriver**: The executable must match your installed Chrome version and be placed in the project's root directory or be accessible via your system's PATH.
-   **Ollama**: Installed and running locally or accessible at a specified host URL. Download from [ollama.com](https://ollama.com/).
-   **An Ollama LLM Model**: You need to have pulled a model (e.g., `gemma3:1b`, `gemma:2b`, `llama3`). Use `ollama pull <model_name>`.

## üöÄ Installation

Clone the repository and install the required Python dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git # Replace with your repo URL
cd your-repo-name
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*(Remember to place the `chromedriver` executable in this directory)*

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

Run the MCQ generator from your command line. You must provide either a single URL or a file containing multiple URLs.

**Basic Command Structure:**

```bash
python mcq_generator.py [--url <single_url> | --urls-file <path_to_file>] [--class <level>] [--model <ollama_model>] [--host <ollama_host>]
```

**Examples:**

*   Process a single URL for Class 12:
    ```bash
    python mcq_generator.py --url "https://some-educational-site.com/physics-mcqs" --class 12
    ```
*   Process multiple URLs from `links.txt` for Class 10 using a specific model:
    ```bash
    python mcq_generator.py --urls-file links.txt --class 10 --model gemma:2b
    ```

## üíæ Output

The script generates JSON files containing the processed MCQs and saves them within the `mcq_output/` directory (created automatically):

-   `formatted_mcqs_<sanitized_url_filename>.json`: Contains MCQs extracted from the URL and then enhanced/formatted by the AI.
-   `generated_mcqs_<sanitized_url_filename>.json`: Contains new MCQs generated by the AI based on the topic of the source URL.
-   `batch_results.json`: (If using `--urls-file`) An aggregated file containing results for all processed URLs in the batch.
